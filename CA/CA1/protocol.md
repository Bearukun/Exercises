# Chat protocol for CA1

This protocol was defined by the students in the class on the 13th of February.
You are expected to implement this protocol both on the server and the client,
to allow them to communicate. In the client -> server section, the client sends
commands to the server which the server reacts upon. In the server -> client
section, the server sends messages to all the clients currently logged in.

## Client -> Server
These messages should arrive _to_ the server _from_ the client.

| Command | Description | Examples |
| ------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Login   | Logs in the client | ... |
